create a algorithm visualizer 
--generate a array size which is chosen by the users
--the sorting only starts when the start button is hit
--write all the sorting algorithm by yourself some external help can be taken but do it by yourself
--after succesfully generating the arrays on the display build three to four other to your needs or all the arrays in the same display
--also add a time counter that counts the algorithms time taken to solve the array
--build a function that can be speed up when the algorithm is running
--after all the algorithms have sorted there arrays declare who was the fastest
