## 📝 Submission Note

I tried to implement as many features from the assignment as I could. While I wasn't able to complete everything, I gave it my best and focused on building a solid and scalable foundation.

This was a challenging project — many of the features were quite advanced, and each new addition introduced complex issues. Often, something would break unexpectedly, which consumed valuable time. One of the major hurdles was the nature of the API: it wasn’t straightforward and involved many nested links and structures, making it confusing and difficult to work with efficiently.

Despite these challenges, I was able to implement:

* A clean project structure with organized folders (`components`, `hooks`, `contexts`, etc.)
* Pagination with selectable items per page
* Sorting and multi-type filtering in the list view
* A Pokémon detail view showing stats, abilities, species info, and evolution chain
* A working favorites system using `localStorage` and the React Context API
* A comparison tool for viewing Pokémon stats side-by-side
* Performance optimizations using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and custom hooks
* A skeleton UI to handle loading states gracefully
* Basic error handling with fallback UIs

I also added a little styling to the search bar to make it look clean and clear. I truly wanted to make the entire app visually appealing, but I couldn't due to the limited time.

This project needed more time and planning than was available. It was definitely not a beginner-level task, and I wish I had a few more days to polish everything.

**Sorry I couldn't complete all the requirements, but I tried my best and did most of them. I hope you analyse it fairly.**

Thank you!
