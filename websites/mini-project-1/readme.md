Search Page Layout


---Search Bar---

--The search bar will be the central feature at the top of the page.

--Food Item Search: When a user types a food item name (e.g., "burger" or "pasta"), it searches the database for matching items and displays them as cards below the search bar.

--Suggestions: As the user types, display suggestions in a list. Suggestions could include food items and restaurant names, with icons or labels to differentiate them.

-Food Items Container: Displays food items found in the search results. This container can use a grid layout to show individual food item cards.

-Restaurants Container: Shows the restaurant card (a larger card format) when searching for a restaurant name.


---Food Category Section---

--A separate section below the search bar or on the side of the page can display food categories (e.g., Burgers, Pasta, Salads).

--Category Cards: Each card represents a category with an image and a category name. These should be visually distinct and clickable.

--On Click: When a user clicks a category card, it filters and displays all food items in that category in the Food Items Container. This allows users to quickly browse through different types of food.

--Card Elements:
